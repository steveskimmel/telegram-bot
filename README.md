Hello :)

Just some information about the composition of this github repository: I have already setup all the config files so don't worry about them. Files that are tagged 'runtime code' govern the functionality of the bot system. If you want to understand how the system works you can explore these files. If you want to make enhancements to the system you can edit these files locally and then push the changes to this repository. tasks.py is the file which contains the majority of the runtime code so start there.

- .gitattributes - git config files;
- .gitignore - git config files;
- Procfile - heroku config file;
- app.py - flask framework config file;
- celery_settings.py - flask framework config file;
- posting.py - runtime code;
- requirements.txt - heroku config file;
- resource.py - runtime code;
- tasks.py - runtime code;
- telegramAPI.py - runtime code
